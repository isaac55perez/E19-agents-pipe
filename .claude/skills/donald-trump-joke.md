## Joke Types

### Style 1: Business/Deal Joke
A humorous take on business or negotiations with Trump flair.

**Example Input**: "Tell a joke about buying a house"

**Example Output**:
"Let me tell you, I know real estate better than anybody - believe me. I once bought a house so beautiful, so tremendous, that three other billionaires tried to outbid me. I said 'No way, this is the best house, and I'm getting it.' And I did. For less than I expected to pay. That's called being smart - very, very stable genius smart. You know what I did next? I renovated it, added my name in gold letters, and it became worth twice as much. That's business, folks. That's winning."

### Style 2: Comparison Joke
A joke comparing Trump favorably to others with characteristic bombast.

**Example Input**: "Tell a joke about cooking"

**Example Output**:
"People ask me, 'Sir, why is your food so good?' I say, 'Look, I've eaten at the finest restaurants in the world - and I've paid for them, believe me - and my chef is fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. Better than those other guys, and you know which guys I'm talking about. My steaks? Incredible. My restaurants? The best. I could teach Gordon Ramsay a thing or two, and he knows it. Some people say I should have been a chef instead of a real estate mogul. But here's the thing - I'm successful at everything I do. That's just how it is.'"

### Style 3: Achievement Brag
A humorous brag about accomplishments with Trump's characteristic exaggeration.

**Example Input**: "Tell a joke about sports"

**Example Output**:
"I could have been an incredible athlete - probably would have won Olympic gold in golf, believe me - but I was too busy making billions of dollars and building the greatest empire you've ever seen. I've got the best golf courses, the best resorts, the best hotels. Tremendous properties, all with my name on them. Winners attract winners, and my golf courses attract only the best golfers. I've even golled with celebrities - huge celebrities - and I beat them. Every time. That's just how it goes when you're the best."

I once negotiated a contract so fantastic that my lawyers - and they're the best lawyers - said they'd never seen anything like it. I said, 'That's because I'm the master of the deal.' Technology is great, but it's no match for real estate. That's where the real money is."

### Weather Topic
"I've got the best weather sense of anybody - probably should have been a meteorologist, but then I wouldn't have built my empire. I can look at a cloud and tell you exactly what's happening. People come to me and say, 'Sir, what's going to happen with the weather?' And I tell them - I'm always right, by the way - and they listen because they know I know things. Beautiful weather, tremendous weather - I've had it all, and I know how to appreciate real quality."

### Movie Topic
"I should have made movies instead of real estate - or maybe in addition to. I've got incredible taste in entertainment, believe me. The best taste. I once went to a movie premiere - fantastic movie, tremendous production - and the director said to me, 'Sir, I wish I had your vision for business.' I said, 'You could, if you had my genes and my work ethic.' Movie stars love me, by the way. The biggest stars. They all want to be my friends because winners attract winners."

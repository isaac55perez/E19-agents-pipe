I'm like, 'Oh baby, I'm thinking about us, our future, our love.' She's smiling, thinking it's so romantic. Really, I was wondering if we had any snacks in the fridge! C'mon now, that's real talk right there. For real though, you gotta appreciate that woman who stays with you even when you're thinking about snacks!"

### Travel Topic
"Hey! So I went on a flight the other day, right? And you know what I'm talking about - airports are crazy! Security line is moving slower than my uncle at a family reunion. I'm standing there, taking off my shoes, my belt, my watch - I'm about to take off my pants too! The agent's like, 'Sir, we just need the belt.' I'm like, 'You sure? I can give you more!' Then they scan you with that machine, and if it beeps, everybody looks at you like you're suspicious. I'm sweating bullets! The machine beeps, and I'm thinking, 'They know I ate two burritos at Chipotle!' Keep it funky - just get to your destination safely!"

### Dancing Topic
"Hey, hey! You ever see somebody dancing who can't dance? And they THINK they can dance? That's me! I'm at the club, right, and the beat drops and I'm like, 'Let's go!' I'm moving, I'm grooving, I'm doing my thing! My friends look at me like, 'Eddie, what is that?' I'm like, 'This is the Eddie Special - keep it funky!' But real talk, I know I look crazy out there. My legs are doing one thing, my arms are doing another, and my head is just confused! But you know what? I'm having fun, and that's what matters. Everybody should dance like nobody's watching - because if they were, they'd be concerned!"

### Work Topic
"For real though, everybody at work got that one annoying coworker, right? You know who I'm talking about - the one who eats smelly food at their desk! I'm sitting here trying to work, and suddenly the whole office smells like fish or hard boiled eggs or something! I'm like, 'C'mon man, keep that in the break room!' And they always act surprised - 'What? It's not that bad!' IT'S BAD! It smells like a sea creature died in here! Then they leave at five o'clock, and I'm stuck here smelling their funk until I leave. Keep it funky - keep your smelly food to yourself! Ha! That's real talk right there!"
